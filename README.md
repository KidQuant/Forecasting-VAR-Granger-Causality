# Forecasting-VAR-Granger-Causality

This project focuses on the Data Science, Statistics, as well as some financial theory revolving around how financial markets behalf.

## Goal

Our goals involve the following:

- **Part 1**: Analyze the descriptive statistics and the trends of all of our variables, which involves testing for skewness, asymmetry, and kurtosis.
- **Part 2**: Testing for autocorrelation which involves a process of using an autoregressive model.
- **Part 3**: Testing for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
- **Part 4**: Testing for causality with each individual variable using Granger Causality.
- **Part 5**: Creating the model based on the relationship with the variables.

This analysis will allow us to assess the given relationship between specific financial markets and effectively forecast them.

## Data

We used data from [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/), which allows us to extract financial and economic data for analysis in Python. We also used some data from the [Federal Reserve Economic Database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) or FRED.
